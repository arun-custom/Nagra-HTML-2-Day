# Nagra HTML, CSS, JS Introduction

##### HTML and CSS
- HTML and CSS work together to create the front end structure and design.
- Front end frameworks and the grid system.

##### Tags:
- Tags allow you to set up your document's structure.
- Attributes allow you to add additional information to a tag.
- Attributes also allow you to bridge the gap between HTML and CSS.

##### Div:
- Divs are like empty rectangles.
- They help organize content on the page.

```html
<div class="margin-top-20 logo">
	My Text Inside
</div>
```

##### Input:
- Inputs allow users to enter data to be saved to a database.
- They come in different forms to facilitate the specific data entry type.

```html
<input type="text" class="form-control" />
```

##### Select list:
- Select lists allow users to select options from a dropdown menu.

```html
<select>
	<option value="USA">United States</option>
</select>
```

##### Button:
- Buttons are HTML elements that give users the ability to submit the data entered as well as transition to new pages.

```html
<button>My Button</button>
```

##### Linking CSS with HTML
- CSS creates the look and feel of the website.
- In order to run external CSS you need to link it to the HTML. This usually goes in the `head` tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/mystyle.css" />
```

##### Linking JS with HTML
- JavaScript enables interaction with the page.
- In order to run external JS you need to link it to the HTML. This usually goes before the closing `body` tag:

```html
<script src="js/script.js"></script>
```

## HTML Markup Lab
- Open the `html_form` folder and open `index.html`.
- For each comment denoted by `<!-- -->` replace the comment text with the correct HTML as per the instruction to create the form.
- Alter the CSS file to use a Google Fonts font. You will need to use the `font-family` CSS property.
- Bonus: Use CSS to change the background color of the page. Experiment with using images as backgrounds as well.
- Double Bonus: Review the CSS `transition` property documentation and try to create a small animation anywhere on the form. An example may be to highlight a border around a form field when it is clicked.

## New Tags in HTML5
- HTML5 introduced a number of "semantic" tags that give meaning to your markup.
- These new tags play a role in SEO to allow for contextual analysis of content blocks.
- Let's take a look at a list of new semantic tags [here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp).

## CSS and CSS3 Selectors
- Selectors play a key role in selecting DOM elements for styling.
- There are common selectors that have been around awhile, and also new selectors that give us even more control as of CSS3.
- Let's take a look at some of the most common CSS3 selectors [here](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp).

## Shakespeare's Plays Exercise
- For this exercise we will be using the files [here](shakespeares_plays/).
- Select the `<ul>` with the ID "selected-plays" and place a gray background on it.
- Select the second and third `<h2>` elements (hint: they have classes) and make the font size larger and give them some space below.
- Change the background color of the third column of a table to gray.
- Select the `<li>` elements at the second level of the nested list and change the font color to red.
- Make every other table row in both tables have a gray background.
- Select an anchor tag that has a link to a pdf file. Change the color to blue and increase the font size.
- Select an anchor tag that has an href attribute containing the substring "asyoulikeit" and change the font color to orange.

## Selector Exercise
- Let's use Codepen.io to practice CSS selectors.
- Create at least one div with an id, and four divs with a class.
- Use CSS to apply styling to the divs based on the id and class selectors.
- Bonus: Try implementing one or more styles using a CSS3 selector (first-child, nth-child, first-of-type, etc).

## Floats
- Floating elements allows us to create a nearly unlimited number of layouts using all types of block elements.
- Floating an element essentially removes it from the standard "flow" and places it to the left or right side of its container.
- Elements can have fixed width, which will wrap underneath each other if the container is smaller than the combined widths.
- You can also used percentage width, which will have the columns respond to the screen size.
- You can tell already that the calculations can get out of hand really fast...

## Element Alignment
- To determine how we can align an element we have to first know what kind of element it is.
- Inline elements can be aligned as text, so with the `text-align` CSS property.
- Block elements can be aligned using the space around them - margin. A margin set to auto for both left and right will center the element in a container.

## The Grid Layout
- Most modern layouts operate on a standard 12-column grid system.
- If you break down any of the websites you know and love you will notice many variations on the 12 column grid.
- Each column in the grid can contain nested grids itself.
- If you want a larger box, you need to have a greater column offset.
- Here is a good pictorial to help you break it down:

## Code-Along: Let's Create Our Own Grid
- We will create a 2, 4, and 6 column grid.
- We will try nesting a grid inside another grid.

## CSS Positioning
- There are four main types of positioning that you will see most often - static, relative, absolute, and fixed.
- Static positioning is what all elements have by default. Yay!
- Relative and absolute work together - elements can be positioned absolutely relative to their container.
- Fixed position elements are essentially absolute relative to the window no matter where they are in the DOM. A.K.A. the window is always the relative parent.

## Positioning Exercise
- Try to replicate the following mockups using what we've talked about in this class so far.
- Utilize margins, padding, floats, positioning, etc.

1. Stackers!

## CSS3 Media Queries
- Media queries allow you to apply and remove CSS styling based on the screen dimensions.
- This is important to create truly mobile-friendly layouts.
- To use it you have to specify screen resolution thresholds.
- Let's try an example where we want to show a div where the screen size is larger than 700 pixels:

HTML

```html
<div id="my-div"></div>
```

CSS

```css
@media(min-width: 700px) {
	#my-div {
		width:400px;
		height:400px;
		border:#000 1px solid;
	}
}
```

- Now where the screen size is below 700 pixels:

CSS

```css
@media(max-width: 700px) {
	#my-div {
		width:400px;
		height:400px;
		border:#000 1px solid;
	}
}
```

- You can also combine these values to select a range:

```css
@media(min-width: 700px) and (max-width: 900px) {
	#my-div {
		width:400px;
		height:400px;
		border:#000 1px solid;
	}
}
```
